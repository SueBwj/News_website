        Doubts have been raised over the veracity of a new image of Kate

        her health and whereabouts following her surgery in January. Here, she’s

        Kate Middleton had seemingly broken her silence after undergoing surgery
        in January with a picture and message shared on social media in honor of
        Mothering Sunday in the U.K., but within just a few hours, news wire
        agencies including the Associated Press and Reuters retracted the
        photograph over suspicions of manipulation—fueling further speculation
        about Middleton’s health status and whereabouts, which have recently
        appeared shrouded in secrecy and misdirection.
      </p>
      <p>
        On March 10, the Prince and Princess of Wales’ X (formerly Twitter) and
        Instagram accounts posted a picture of the future queen, 42, with her
        three children—George, 10, Charlotte, 8, and Louis, 5. The photo is
        dated 2024 and credited to her husband, Prince William, 41.

        “Thank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two
        months. Wishing everyone a Happy Mother’s Day. C,” the caption for the
        posts read, signing off with the first letter of her full name,
        Catherine.

        The royal couple often post family pictures to mark holidays and special
        occasions, frequently opting to take their own pictures instead of
        hiring a professional photographer, which has traditionally been the
        custom for the royal family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several news wire agencies originally published the photo, as provided
        by Kensington Palace, but later removed it. “At closer inspection, it
        appeared the source had manipulated the image in a way that did not meet
        AP’s photo standards,” the Associated Press said after issuing a “kill
        notification,” an industry term flagging the withdrawal to its partner
        publishers. “The photo shows an inconsistency in the alignment of
        Princess Charlotte’s left hand.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Reuters said it also pulled the photo “following a post-publication
        review,” citing its picture editors who found that “part of the sleeve
        of Kate’s daughter’s cardigan did not line up properly, suggesting that
        the image had been altered. Reuters could not immediately establish how,
        why or by whom the alteration had been made.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Agence France-Presse (AFP) also issued a “kill” notice to its partner
        publishers, saying the photo had been recalled “due to an editorial
        issue.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Getty Images said in a statement to media outlets that it, too, had
        “identified a problematic image provided to Getty Images by Kensington
        Palace” and that it removed it from its site “in accordance with our
        editorial policy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        PA Media, the large U.K. news agency through which the Royal Family
        often releases information, told TIME in a statement on Monday: “Like
        other news agencies, PA Media issued the handout image provided by
        Kensington Palace of the Princess of Wales and her children in good
        faith yesterday. We became aware of concerns about the image and we
        carried a report about it last night, and made clear that we were
        seeking urgent clarification about the image from Kensington Palace. In
        the absence of that clarification, we are killing the image from our
        picture service.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kensington Palace press office is not open during weekends and could
        not be immediately reached for comment. The social media posts remained
        up as of Sunday night.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Monday morning, the Prince and Princess of Wales’ social media
        accounts shared an explanation from Middleton: “Like many amateur
        photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to
        express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared
        yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s
        Day,” once again signed C.
